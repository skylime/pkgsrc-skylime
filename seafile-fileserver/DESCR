Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system with
advanced support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Seafile fileserver written in Go is the replacement of ccnet daemon.

In our initial design, Ccnet worked like a traffic bus. All the network traffic
between client, server and internal traffic between different components would
go through Ccnet. After further development we found that file transfer is 
improved by utilizing the Seafile daemon component directly.
